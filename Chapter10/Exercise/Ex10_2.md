### Exercise 10.2

You have an object made up of eight point masses, each of mass 1, arranged at the corners of a cube of size 2. The positions of each mass are therefore:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}±1 \\±1 \\±1\end{bmatrix}
\]

Calculate the inertia tensor matrix of this object. You will need to use Equations 10.2 and 10.3.



## Solution:

### Moment of Inertia (Equation 10.2):

$$
I_a = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i d_{p_i \to a}^2
$$

Where:

- $m_i$ is the mass of particle $i$
- $d_{p_i \to a}$ is the distance of particle $i$ from the axis of rotation $a$
- $I_a$ is the moment of inertia about the axis $a$

### Moment of Inertia Products (Equation 10.3):

$$
I_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i x_{p_i} y_{p_i}
$$

Where:

- $x_{p_i}$ and $y_{p_i}$ are the distances of the particle $i$ from the center of mass along the X and Y axes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

Given that there are 8 point masses, each of mass 1, located at the corners of a cube of size 2, the positions of the masses are the coordinates $\pm1$ for $x$, $y$, and $z$.

The particles are at the following positions:
$$
\{(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, -1, 1), (1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1), (-1, -1, -1)\}
$$
Since the mass of each particle is 1, we can use the sum over all particles to compute the inertia tensor components.

1. **Calculate the diagonal terms of the inertia tensor:**
   - $I_{xx} = \sum m_i (y_i^2 + z_i^2)$
   - $I_{yy} = \sum m_i (x_i^2 + z_i^2)$
   - $I_{zz} = \sum m_i (x_i^2 + y_i^2)$
2. **Calculate the off-diagonal terms of the inertia tensor:**
   - $I_{xy} = \sum m_i x_i y_i$
   - $I_{xz} = \sum m_i x_i z_i$
   - $I_{yz} = \sum m_i y_i z_i$

Let me proceed with calculating these terms based on the given positions.

The inertia tensor matrix for the object is:
$$
I = \begin{pmatrix}
16 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 16 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 16
\end{pmatrix}
$$
This result indicates that the object has uniform moments of inertia along each axis of 16, with no off-diagonal products of inertia. This is because of the symmetric arrangement of the point masses at the corners of the cube.
